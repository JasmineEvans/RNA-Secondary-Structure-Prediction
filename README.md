# RNA-Secondary-Structure-Prediction
Combinatorial Method for RNA secondary structure prediction

A dynamic programming algorithm derived from RNA combinatorics, specifically lattice paths, to model predicted RNA secondary structures. The developed lattice walk algorithm graphically depicts a certain subset of lattice walks, a type of combinatorial object enumerated by the RNA numbers, which correspond to RNA secondary sequences composed of the nucleotides over the string of letters \{A,C,G,U\}. The algorithm visualizes all possible predicted folds of an RNA sequence
